# sss
SkilStak Script Support is a help desk for SkilStak by @whitman-colm on github and @donovank on github.


##The Story so far:
As of now, S3 will send an email to TAs with priotity, software and discription of the problem. S3 is also it's own repo.

##What's happening now:
What Is planned to happen next release
* Whitman is now modualifying the whole thing so that the main.go is only ~30 lines
* Whitman is slacking(?) mr. rob to get some input and his brilliant feature-of-the-week
* Donovank is making a UUID Gen for the tickets

##What's next:
There is no way this is complete. But we can improve it in many ways, here's a list:
* ~~Make the email bot a module to cut down on shitty complex 200 line files~~ **Currently being worked on!**
* Give a link to the source code here.
* Make the whole thing more graphicly appealing.
* Make the program feel less "Whitman stiff"
* ~~UUID Generator so TAs can look back at whats done.~~ **Currently being worked on!**
* FAQ to curb the inevitable influx of tickets with answers for common troubles.
* Message to Mr. Rob if there's an urgent ticket.
* Make the skilstakticketer password not in plain sight and plaintext.
* Find a way to prevent "silly" tickets (*cough* donovank *cough*)
* Find a way to prevent TAs being jerks.
* Sort gMail inbox

##Running the program
When it launches, s3 can be called with sss for the stable version or ssse for the experimental version (now with 50% more bugs!).
