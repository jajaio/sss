# SSS
SkilStak Support System is a help desk for SkilStak by [whitman-colm](https://github.com/whitman-colm), [CoderPythonX](https://github.com/tslnc04) and [dfk](https://github.com/donovank) on github.

### There is a FAQ website
S3's FAQ source code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/whitman-colm/sss-faq) and, as of now, the actual site is not up, although Whitman is trying to get **sss.skilstak.io**

## The Story so far:
As of now, S3 will send an email to TAs with priotity, software and discription of the problem and a Unique identifier. S3 is also it's own repo.

## What's happening now:
What Is planned to happen next release
* Whitman is slacking(?) Mr. Rob to get some input and his brilliant **\s** feature-of-the-week (If you don't like it, it's okay, he'll change his mind next week)

## What's next:
There is no way this is complete. But we can improve it in many ways, here's a list:
* Give a link to the source code here.
* ~Make the whole thing more graphicly appealing.~ **Started with main
  UI**
* Make the program feel less "Whitman stiff"
* ~~FAQ to curb the inevitable influx of tickets with answers for common troubles.~~ **view top**
* Message to Mr. Rob if there's an urgent ticket.
* Find a way to prevent "silly" tickets (*cough* donovank *cough*)
* Find a way to prevent TAs being jerks.

##Running the program
When it launches, s3 can be called with sss anywhere on the command line. While it is installed at this time, we ask that you use it with knowlege that it does not represent the finished product and that it's still in beta and any tickets will not be taken as legitimate problems. Wait a few weeks. Put your errors on the #sss slack room and TAs will try to hep there.
