SkilStak Support System is a help desk for SkilStak by @whitman-colm on github.


##The Story so far:
As of now, S3 will send an email to TAs with priotity, software and discription of the problem. S3 is also it's own repo.

##What's happening now:
What Is planned to happen next release
* Whitman is now working on finding a way to make a UUID Gen.
* Whitman is slacking(?) mr. rob to get some input and his brilliant feature-of-the-week (If you don't like it, it's ok, he'll change it net week)
* Donovank has been ...fired(?) for doing absolutly nothing.

##What's next:
There is no way this is complete. But we can improve it in many ways, here's a list:
* ~~Fix $GOPATH env variables.~~ **Currently being worked on**
* Give a link to the source code here.
* Make the whole thing more graphicly appealing.
* Make the program feel less "Whitman stiff"
* UUID Generator so TAs can look back at whats done.
* FAQ to curb the inevitable influx of tickets with answers for common troubles.
* Message to Mr. Rob if there's an urgent ticket.
* ~~Make the skilstakticketer password not in plain sight and plaintext.~~ **Nuts to it, the worst result is somebody getting into an email with no data relating to skilstak and us having to get a new email.**
* Find a way to prevent "silly" tickets (*cough* donovank *cough*)
* Find a way to prevent TAs being jerks.

##Running the program
When it launches, s3 can be called with sss anywhere on the command line. While it is installed at this time, we ask that you use it with knowlege that it does not represent the finished product and that it's still in beta and any tickets will not be taken as legitimate problems. Wait a few weeks. Put your errors on the #sss slack room and we'll try to hep there.
